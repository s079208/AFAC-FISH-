CSS-in-JS makes it easy to think of our user interfaces as a series of components

The Styled Components library works by allowing us to define the styles of an element
using JavaScript’s template literal syntax. We create a JavaScript variable that will refer
to an HTML element and its associated styles.

We can easily scope styles. Additionally, we are scoping our style to that specifiÒc component.

- We maken een button component => Component Styles

- We voegen Global Styles toe
